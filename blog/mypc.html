				<h1>My PC</h1>
				<div class="widecontent">By Sigton, 29/11/16</div><br />
				<div class="content">Woo-hoo! I got a gaming PC, as you can see to the right.
				It cost just a smidge over £900, and works brilliantly! Money well spent, I tell you. I'm now saving my pennies for the full gaming setup... <br /><br />
				A quick specs list: Graphics Card is the ASUS Strix GTX 960 4GB, CPU is AMD FX 8350 8-core 4GHz, RAM is HyperX Savage 16GB (2x8GB) 2330MHz.
				I've got a Kingston 240GB SSD then a secondary 1TB HDD, a 450-watt Corsair power supply and again Corsair water cooling. The motherboard is Gigabyte, but I'm not sure what the model name is.
				The case is fantastic; it's the NZXT Phantom 410. I recommend it greatly.
				<br /><br />As for speed, I clocked 2,500 frames per second while playing Minecraft (on low settings). With all settings on maximum I range from 200fps to 800fps.</div>
				<div class="content"><img src="../resources/pc.jpg" alt="My super amazing PC"></div>
				<div class="widecontent">I got my PC from <a href="https://www.cyberpowersystem.co.uk/">Cyber Power Systems</a>, and they were great.
				Their website allows you to choose from hundreds of different parts to fully customize your PC. Their prices are decent too.
				It only took 10 days or so for them to build and deliver it, which is most impressive. Great company, I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a custom
				gaming pc who isn't wanting to build it themselves.</div>
